# PythonToPseudocode
This code converts normal python to code to pseudocode 

All you have todo is:
  + Run the file called `input.py`
  + Then enter the code
  + Then press `ctrl+d` <a href="https://github.com/JagTheFriend/PythonToPseudocode/new/master?readme=1#if-ctrld-does-not-work-then"> (Click here if this doesnt work) </a>
  + Then a output: _Processing your code_ must appear
  + And after few seconds, another output: `Your code has been processed successfully Please check the file named: output.txt` would appear
  + Then check out the file named `output.txt`
  

## If `ctrl+d` does not work then:
  + Paste the _python code_ into the file named `code.txt`
  + Then run the file called `translator.py`
  + Then wait for few seconds/minutes
  + Then check the file called `output.txt`

This translator is not super-perfect, but its works!
